This is where I will submit my advent of code attempts

# 2025: Decorate the North Pole

## Day 1: Secret Entrance

Not too bad, I decided to use argparse to make it command line executable which is usually a nice skill to know.

## Day 2: Gift Shop

A good friend Regex returns, which made this a suprisingly simple problem. I accidently solved part 2 first so got the worng answer initally when trying to solve part 1 and didn't realise.

## Day 3: Lobby


# 2024: Finding the Chief Historian

## Day 1: Historian Hysteria

This problem boils down to list comparisons. I decided to use a python script for this since I wanted to try and create a bubble sorting algorithm, which is something I probably wont use generally but still useful to know how to code.

## Day 2: Red Nosed Reports

I wanted to use languages I haven't got much experience in for most of AoC so for this chanllange I decided to use Julia. I wrote over the code for part 1 since part 2 is essentially the same idea but with just one extra step.

## Day 3: Mull It Over

An interesting introduction to regular expressions within Julia. I found it useful for learning some of the Regex notation.

## Day 4: Cerers Search

This problem was another interesting one. I originally wanted to code an explicit search for the 'XMAS' in both parts similar to the use in Day 3 but eventually reverted back to a standard type of algorithm I have written a few times before in python.

## Day 5: Print Queue

Anotehr day where I changed the method of writing my solution part way through although not to necessarily speed up or improve the code. I have likely made it difficult to run since the input needs to be explicitly broken into two parts but that can be done with an external code rather simply. 

## Day 6: Guard Gallivant

I quite liked this one as it seemed fairly simple to use part 1 in part 2 with only a few minor changes. I did make an assumption on the amount of visits of squares creating an infinite loop.

## Day 7: Bridge Repair

I decided to go back to python for this problem. I found the solution simple in python and using a recursion loop that I probably don't use often enough so it was nice to gain extra experience with this.

## Day 8: Resonant Collinearity

A nice challenge, looking at distances between antenna pairs.

## Day 9: Disk Fragmenter

Using a dictionary to assign the length indicated but julia doesn't automatically order dictionaries so I needed a work around.

## Day 10: Hoof It

Created a Breadth First search to identfy a traversable path. I treated it like a word search taking code from my Day 1.
